JUNIT testing project

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
There are a couple of ways to make sure my code or software is functional and secure. Two that come to mind are the Maven dependency checker, which runs your code, points out discrepancies, and gives feedback, and JUnit testing, which runs conditional statements and helps verify that your code behaves as expected. When combined with a debugger or code coverage tools, JUnit can also give insight into how thoroughly your code is tested.

What I really like about Maven dependency checker is that the information it provides can point out vulnerabilities, most of which can often be traced back to bad code, outdated plugins, or other small issues that are easy to fix once identified.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
You can interpret user needs by receiving feedback from users or asking questions. Itâ€™s also possible to ask yourself what you would expect from this software if it were fully functional.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by first interpreting what I need to accomplish and why. Then I develop pseudocode and a plan to properly document TODOs and objectives. From there, I code and research fixes to any issues I run into.
